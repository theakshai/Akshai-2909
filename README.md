### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Akshai

I am a **final year student at SASTRA Deemed to be University** pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in **Electronics and Communication Enginnering**. I'm interested in Web application Development, especially Backend. I am currently a core team member of WebDev Cluster in **Developer Community SASTRA** and a designer is **300dpi ( Official Design team of SASTRA )**. I am also been a part of **E-cell SASTRA** as a marketing associate. I have worked on API development in Fastapi and Express, Frontend Dev with React and Bootstrap. 

I am majorly interested in developing applications using javascript. I am also trying to learn system design, clean architecture and deep down concepts in Networks. I am also interested in Security concepts and general physics and I pursue it in my free time.

I joined DCS in my first year as a non-tech core team member in social-media handling & marketing cluster for my goal towards learning and helping. With the help of seniors and the DSC ( previously DCS) community I learned a lot and moved into the technical webdev cluster. Currently I am working towards helping our University students and trying to help the commnuity as best as we can.
